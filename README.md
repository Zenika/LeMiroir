## Create a plugin

Marcel is based on plugins, and we need you to complete the collection !

By convention, a plugin should have a name begin with `marcel-plugin-*` (`marcel-plugin-text` for example).
This ways, you can find a list of all available plugins by [searching them on github](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=marcel%2Dplugin)

[See the marcel-plugin package to know more about plugin creation.](./node-packages/marcel-plugin)
