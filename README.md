# M.A.R.C.E.L. Project

## Smart Mirror (Miroir A Reflet Connect√© Et Ludique)

MARCEL is a connected mirror that allows you to add plugins to display data about anything. You can for example add a weather forecast or a twitter plugin and see what the weather will be and the last tweet on a subject.

The main objective of the project is to be plug and play so anybody can add it on his own mirror and develop their own plugins.
